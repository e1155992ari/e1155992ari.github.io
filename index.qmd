## How can video game developers draw in more success for their games?

To answer this question, I will be using data visualisations from the following dataset: **Discovering Hidden Trends in Global Video Games: Platforms, Genres and Profitable Regions** by Andy Bramwell. Link: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/discovering-hidden-trends-in-global-video-games>

### Analysis 1: 
This analysis is meant to analyse how the genre classification of a game may contribute to its sales/the number of copies sold, which would determine how well a game performs in the video game industry after release. Specifically, this Shiny visualisation tracks the sales/copies of games sold by genre over time, allowing for not only an individual analysis of each genre over a selected period of time, but also for comparisons across genres.

Some key observations:

     1. Genres such as **Sports** and **Racing** became increasingly popular over time, as noted by the relative height of their peaks being much higher than other games. Interestingly, the sales of **Sports** was much, much higher in recent years as compared to other genres in 2006, despite the number of copies being sold in total being rather low.

    2. Genres such as **Platform** were much more popular back in the day, as noted by how in the earlier time frame it registered more sales than all other games.
    
    3. Some genres, such as **Strategy** generated consistently low sales over time as compared to other genres.
    
    4. Overall, however, there seems to be not much of a clear, visible relationship that can be inferred between a game's genre and its sales.
    
    5. That said, when navigating over to the visualisation option that allows for a look at how genres have been performing over time with regards to the number of copies sold, there is a visible increasing trend overall for all genres.
    
This analysis, therefore, suggests that genre does play a role in determining how successful a game in the industry. If developers are looking to tap into more niche genres of games, they may therefore want to consider incorporating other more popular general genres (e.g. Platform/Simulation/Role-Playing) into these niche genres to potentially draw in more sales and copies sold.
